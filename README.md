# Tic Tac Toe Game in C++ (OOP-Based with AI)

Welcome to this simple terminal-based Tic Tac Toe game built using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles in C++. This project demonstrates core OOP concepts and includes an intelligent AI opponent using the Minimax algorithm.

## Features

- Two-player mode (X vs O)
- Single-player mode against AI
- Intuitive terminal interface
- Input validation and turn-based logic
- Win, draw, and invalid move detection
- Modular design with clear separation of concerns

## Project Structure

- **Game.h** – Controls the main game loop, player turns, and mode selection
- **Player.h** – Manages player data and human player inputs
- **AIPlayer.h** – Implements AI logic with Minimax algorithm
- **Board.h** – Manages the game board state and rendering

## How to Compile and Run

### Requirements

- A C++ compiler supporting C++11 or later (e.g., g++, clang++)
- Terminal or command prompt

### Compilation

Compile all source files together. Example using g++
